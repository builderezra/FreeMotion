# Ezra's requests — the running list

**This file is the record of everything Ezra has asked for.** Every request goes in here the moment
he makes it, however small, in the order he said it. Nothing is judged too minor to write down —
"make the arrow look nice" is a line in this file the same as "fix the export".

**The rules, for Claude:**
1. A new request gets added to **Open** immediately, before any work starts on it. If it arrives
   while something else is in flight, it still gets written down first.
2. Work them roughly **in order**, oldest first, unless Ezra says otherwise or something is
   genuinely blocking (a bug that destroys work jumps the queue — say so when it does).
3. When one ships, move it to **Done** with the version it shipped in. Don't delete it — Ezra should
   be able to scroll back and see the whole history.
4. Quote his own words where they're short enough. His phrasing is usually more precise about what
   he actually wants than a tidied-up restatement.
5. If something is deliberately NOT being done, it stays in Open with a **Held** note saying why.
   Silently dropping a request is the failure this file exists to prevent.

Detail on how each shipped item was built lives in [POLISH-LOG.md](POLISH-LOG.md), one line per
version. This file is the *what and whether*; that one is the *how*.

## Open

Numbered with Ezra's own queue numbers where he gave them.

### In flight right now

### Bugs
- [x] **Captions never open the text editor.** **DONE v6.36.** `addCaptionLayer` added the track and
      stopped; `addTextLayer` opens the editor on its placeholder. Now it scrubs to the first cue and
      opens the editor on it, which is the same pair the cue buttons in the Aa sheet already used.
- [ ] **Six effects' option buttons run off a phone, last options untappable.** Measured at 380px:
      Channel Remap overflows by 434px, HSL Bands 169, Text Transform 106, Mirror 97, Thermal 71,
      Match Grade 25. Pre-existing. The fix is a taste call — equal-width-with-ellipsis vs wrapping to
      two rows vs horizontal scroll — so it is yours to pick.
- [ ] **Landscape phone (844x390) text editing is cramped** — 56x99 preview, because the app reserves
      the timeline row above 700px. The card no longer covers it, but the row reservation is untouched.
- [ ] **Playhead missing when a project opens.** Needs an app restart to come back.
      *Status (v6.31):* the known cause IS fixed and now tested on BOTH paths — a recompute landing
      mid-animation no longer stores the translated edge, on the project-open push and on the
      return-to-home pop that v6.27 added. Measured drift under 1px on both, with a control assertion
      proving the panel really was moving so the test cannot pass vacuously.
      **Left open on purpose:** Ezra reported this AFTER the first fix, so if it happens again it is a
      third cause and these two are ruled out. Worth knowing next time: does the playhead ELEMENT
      exist and is it just mispositioned, or is it missing from the DOM entirely?
- [ ] **Editing lags, and gets bad fast.** *Status (v6.33):* the two measured causes are fixed —
      playback went 95.09 → 17.43 ms/frame on a 6-layer comp (5.5x, dropped frames 191 → 3) and
      forced layouts per tap are now FLAT with layer count instead of linear (211 → 5 at 80 layers).
      Left open until Ezra confirms it feels better on his own device and projects.
      **Known and NOT fixed:** FM.media never releases a deleted clip's record, so memory grows with
      every import you throw away. That one needs undo-stack surgery and was deliberately deferred.
- [ ] **72 — Audio import loses parts of the file.** *"when it's importing the audio it literally cuts
      out certain parts making it jumpy, even on the timeline you can see how it's missing parts"*.
      Not lag — actual missing audio. **HALF DONE, and I owe you an admission on the bookkeeping:**
      the half you can SEE was fixed back in **v6.08** ("fix the gaps in a long clip's waveform") and
      nobody ticked it here, which is the exact thing this file exists to stop. Re-verified from
      scratch tonight with a new probe (`tests/_audiogaps.html`): a synthetic file with no silence in
      it at all, at 10s / 60s / 3min / 5min, decodes to its full length every time and produces **zero
      silent bins** in the drawn waveform. So the timeline is no longer lying to you.
      The half you can HEAR is still open, and I could not reproduce it. What I have RULED OUT, by
      measurement rather than by reading: the decode is not truncated (full duration, all four
      lengths), the decoded audio has no silent spans, the waveform binning invents no holes, and the
      playback sync only hard-seeks past 350ms of drift with a 400ms minimum gap, so it is not
      chopping the sound to stay in time. **What I need from you:** the actual file, or its name and
      format. Synthetic WAV is clean through every path, so whatever this is lives in a real encoder's
      output — a VBR mp3 or an m4a whose duration the browser reports wrong is the obvious suspect and
      I can't conjure one that misbehaves. Related to 69 (audio clock) but not the same bug.
- [x] **58 — The red delete bar flashes during fast scroll** in the effects list. **DONE v6.37.**
      The red panel was painted behind EVERY row all the time, hidden only by an opaque wrapper that
      had `will-change: transform` on it permanently — which makes every row its own compositor
      layer, and lets a fast scroll show the parent (red) before the rows repaint. The gesture code
      was never the problem. Now the panel is hidden outright until a swipe actually starts, so
      there is nothing to flash. Checked in the real app on your phone width, not just in the tests.
- [x] **89 — Letterbox and Border Frame paint over the layers below them.** **DONE v6.35**, on the
      fourth attempt. Both effects drew their frame against the effect PLATE's edges, and that plate
      is the size of the project, not of the layer — so a Letterbox on a small layer barred the whole
      frame, and each kernel forced alpha to 255 there, manufacturing opaque pixels that erased
      whatever was underneath. Both are bounded to the layer's own box now, so they frame the layer
      they are attached to and cannot reach anything else. Three passes were refused first: one no
      longer applied to current code; one snapped to "full-frame" on a 4px tolerance measured in
      plate pixels, which a shrinking preview slipped under; one tested the padded, strided bbox
      instead of the pixels, so a layer a few px inside the frame still erased a rim. The edge test
      now reads the plate's four edge lines directly. The third pass also carried a regression of its
      own — a thin layer whose alpha the strided scan could not see was DELETED from the composite
      rather than left unframed — which is fixed here and now has a test. Verified: 288-config
      byte-identity sweep vs v6.34, 0 full-frame configs changed (saved projects don't shift), 0
      control effects changed; suite 198/198 at desktop and 380px, both new tests mutation-checked.
      Known and left: on a layer only ~1px tall at reduced preview scale the bar/ring can't be drawn
      at all, so it no-ops — exports at scale 1 are unaffected.
- [x] **53 — PC is missing the Group and Mask options.** **DONE v6.38.** The actions were always
      there (the ⧉ menu and right-clicking a clip both had them) but the BUTTON was phone-only —
      measured at 1440x900 with two layers selected, the Group button reports zero size, because it
      lives inside a phone-only media query. So on PC there was nothing in the place you'd look.
      Now the same button sits in the PC bar and opens the same Group / Masking Group menu, appearing
      once you have 2+ layers selected. Checked by actually clicking it in a 1440px window: menu
      opens, Group makes a real group with both layers in it.

### Features and changes
- [ ] **Check I changed the right "Presets".** v6.30 gave live per-layer previews to the preset rows
      in the EFFECTS BROWSER. The inspector category card literally named **Presets** is a different,
      older system (saved effect stacks, no tiles, empty on a fresh install) and is untouched. If the
      menu you meant was that one, say so and I will move it — merging the two is queue 37's real job.
- [ ] **A documented conflict, your call.** `NEXT-SESSION.md:183-192` says in bold *"Supersedes the old
      thumbnail spec — do not build preset thumbnails"* and specs a full-screen preview player instead.
      I built the thumbnails because that is what you asked for tonight. The engine behind them is
      exactly what that player would need, so nothing is wasted either way.
- [x] **68 — Speed should retime keyframes.** **DONE v6.39.** Changing Speed already re-timed the
      clip but left every keyframe where it was, so a 2x speed-up halved the bar and left the
      animation running past the end of it. Now the whole animation stretches with the clip. And
      Speed is offered on **every layer type** — which looks like it undoes 83/38 ("Speed does
      nothing on shapes but is still offered") and doesn't: greying it out was the cheap answer to
      that, and now that it retimes keyframes it genuinely does something on a shape or text layer,
      so the control is live instead of hidden. Checked by actually dragging it on a shape: speed
      100% → 200% takes a 4s clip to 2s and moves its keyframes from 0/2/4 to 0/1/2.
- [ ] **69 — Audio must never lag.** Make the audio clock the master.
- [ ] **70 — Extracted audio should look like an audio track.** *"it doesn't show it like an audio
      file, with the bumps to volume or whatever it's called"* — i.e. a waveform.
- [x] **74 — Swipe up for a full-screen Favourites browser.** **DONE v6.40.** All three sorts, each
      invertible (press the active sort again to flip it) — Recent, Type (grouped under category
      headings) and A–Z. Your choice is remembered. **One decision I made and one I left to you:**
      the swipe lives on its own strip under the page dots rather than on the whole block, because
      the browser scrolls vertically and a swipe-up over the block IS the scroll gesture — claiming
      it would make the page unscrollable right where you need to scroll. The strip is also a button,
      so it can just be tapped. And I did **not** remove the left-right pager between Recents and
      Faves: *"replacing the swipe-right between Recent and Faves"* reads two ways (drop the first
      swipe, or drop the endless swiping through fave pages) and I won't delete a working gesture on
      a coin flip. Tell me which and it's a one-line change.
- [ ] **Tiny: "Color & Light" is spelled the American way** in the effects browser's categories,
      which looks odd next to the "Colouring" rename you asked for in 83. Say the word and I'll
      change it — it's your app's voice, not mine to decide.
- [ ] **Per-effect-slider keyframes.** *"each effect slider having its own key frames still doesn't
      exist fully"*.
- [ ] **47 — Export must not lose the render on a crash,** and should get off the main thread.
      Chunk-replay resume is proven; not landed.
- [ ] **48 — Squish:** a new effect where the layer deforms against the canvas edges. Part of the
      recovered diff (see below).
- [ ] **37 — Presets rework:** AM's "Preset preview" screen. Supersedes the earlier thumbnail spec.
- [ ] **31b — Transform blur can't smear effect- or camera-driven motion.**

### Work that exists but isn't landed
- [ ] **Land the recovered Squish diff.** Same story, 3509 lines, cut against v5.89.
- [ ] **Rebuild the two lost audio diffs** (reverse + misc). These were verified but staged in /tmp and
      the reboot destroyed them. No worktree has them — they are genuinely gone and must be rebuilt.
      *Held:* `audio-envelope` stays deliberately unlanded — its eviction corrupts exports.
- [ ] **Continue the EFFECTS-PLAN build rounds.**
- [ ] **Clear the rest of the BUG-HUNT backlog** (~59 items).

### Held, on purpose
- [ ] **The visual identity pass before any public release.** The UI is modelled on Alight Motion and
      has to be made our own before publishing. See [BEFORE-PUBLISHING.md](BEFORE-PUBLISHING.md).
      *Held because* copying AM was the fast way to build and the app should be worth publishing
      before we spend time on identity — but this gets raised the moment Ezra mentions launching,
      the App Store, a public link, a demo or a tutorial series.

## Done

Newest first. Every one of these has a line in [POLISH-LOG.md](POLISH-LOG.md) with the detail.

- [x] **Voice recorder landed.** Add menu → Audio → "Record voice…". Built weeks ago, lost to the
      reboot before it was ever committed, recovered from a worktree and rebased 40 releases forward —
      v6.34
- [x] **59 — One effect clipboard.** There were two that could not see each other, so copying one
      effect from a row's ⋯ left the panel's Paste greyed out — v6.32
- [x] **Presets preview the selected layer** with the preset applied, instead of a generic sample.
      Also fixed a cache-poisoning bug it exposed — v6.30
- [x] **88 — Text adding fixed on PC.** A desktop layout had never been written — the phone
      bottom-sheet WAS the desktop layout. Also fixed a data-loss bug it exposed — v6.29
- [x] **63 — Fractal Ridges: colour, overlay/blend, and it actually MOVES.** It was measurably a
      still image before — t=0 vs t=0.5 differed by exactly 0 — v6.28
- [x] **64 — Iridescence gained Blur and Motion.** It also did not move at all before — v6.28
- [x] **60 — Returning to home reverses the open animation** — editor leaves right, home returns from
      the left — v6.27
- [x] **Easter egg: pull the home list past the top and it slams back and shakes the screen** — v6.25,
      and on PC by *scrolling* past the top with a wheel or trackpad — v6.26
- [x] **Onion skin, Snapping and Guides are one tap away again,** on the ⛶ view bar. They had moved
      into Settings as agreed, then two of my own later changes buried them three taps deep — v6.24
- [x] **76 — Subtle moving static over every project card,** like the reference photo — v6.23
- [x] **71 — Multi-select bar: group and delete moved to the right.** The bin is deliberately not
      flush in the corner — that is where Export lives, and a reflex aimed at Export must not delete
      your selection. Group takes the outer slot instead — v6.22
- [x] **73 — Clip names stay at the clip's start,** not following the scroll — v6.21
- [x] **67 + 31 — Every numeric inspector control is a real slider,** not a browser range input.
      One fix in `rangeRow` covered all 37 of them — v6.20
- [x] **65 — A finger on a slider no longer eats your scroll** (it was silently zeroing values) — v6.19
- [x] **The PC back button is just the arrow now,** no label — v6.18
- [x] **87 — Selecting templates and elements works** (the bar counted the tap, the card never
      showed it) — v6.17
- [x] **84 — Effect previews render at 2×,** plus the filter-scale bug behind it — v6.16
- [x] **Fill Behind erased every layer beneath it** — the disappearing-layer bug — v6.15
- [x] **85 — Effect category colours are brighter** — v6.14
- [x] **35 — The last ⋯ menu is gone** (the phone's) — v6.14
- [x] **86 — Export sits above the cog** in the Studio rail — v6.14
- [x] **78 — Settings can clear the songs and media import history** — v6.13
- [x] **79 — The home background moves faster** — v6.13
- [x] **75 — OPEN badge reverted, and the open project has a travelling glint** — v6.13
- [x] **The export button's shine is properly blurred** — v6.13
- [x] **80 — The PC settings cog opens the right menu** — v6.13
- [x] **81 — The PC back arrow reads as a back button** — v6.13
- [x] **82 — The project name shows in the ADD panel header** — v6.13
- [x] **83 — "Colour & Fill" is "Colouring", and its icon no longer looks like fire** — v6.13
- [x] **77 — The nine inspector category icons are coloured** — v6.12
- [x] **Paste Style gained Speed and Volume** — v6.11
- [x] **The effect open/close control is findable** — v6.10
- [x] **The logo-crystal buttons went back to Liquid Glass** — v6.09
- [x] **66 — Ezra's own photos are the effect thumbnails**
- [x] **62 — Effects can be favourited, including from the ⋯ menu**
- [x] **61 — Hovering a benchmark turns the highlighted section yellow**

Everything before this is in POLISH-LOG.md from v2.31 onward — roughly 90 more shipped items,
including the camera, captions, speed ramping, the easing editor, the shape library, the Studio
layout, motion blur, the elements browser and the effects browser.
