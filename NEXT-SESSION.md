# Next session — the live queue

Read this first if the session starts with "keep going", "go", or a vague pick-up.
Top to bottom is the order Ezra asked for. **v4.83 — the queue is empty.**

Standing: Ezra is working on the **PC Studio layout** now — *"from now on going to be talking mainly
about pcs studio layout, so just dont change the other versions layout."* Classic desktop and the
phone layout are off-limits unless he asks. (Bug FIXES on phone are of course still wanted — the
audio import fix below was one.)

## Done this session (for context, not to redo)

- **v4.71 / v4.72 — desktop Studio layout.** Settings → Layout → Classic / Studio. Left rail (stops at
  the canvas, not the full height), editing panel docked beside the timeline, band runs edge to edge.
  Pure grid re-placement of four regions that are all direct children of `#app`; ONE `#inspector-panel`
  node, never duplicated. Regression test `studio-layout`.
- **v4.73 — audio import on phone.** Was silently dropping the file: `handleFiles` classified by
  `file.type` only, and phones hand back an EMPTY type for .m4a/.flac/.opus. Now falls back to the
  extension (`FM.mediaKind`). Also narrowed the picker's `accept` for the audio entry, because iOS
  greys audio out in Files when the accept list also carries `image/*`/`video/*`.
- **v4.74 — car shape tyres.**
- **v4.75 — Edit Points no longer closes on a missed tap** (miss is swallowed; touch target 14px -> 26px).
- **v4.76 — tick smoothed** (no point moved; only the end points marked smooth).
- **v4.77 — Motion Blur (Object) surfaced in the Effects list** (drives the existing layer.motionBlur).
- **v4.78 / v4.79 — per-slider keyframes DONE.** Every Move & Transform slider has its own ◆ keying only
  its own property; X and Y independent; Scale rows follow the link state (linked→scale, unlinked→scaleX/scaleY).
  Anchor deliberately excluded (a {kf} anchor NaNs the layer).
- **v4.79b — every diamond is now deletable.** animatedProps and deleteKeyframesAt cover the same
  containers; 12 of 28 keyframed props used to be undeletable. Test `delete-parity`.
- **v4.80 — object motion blur fully moved into Effects** (card with Shutter/Samples/×; M&T checkbox deleted).
- **v4.81 — Elements browser** with search (js/elements-browser.js); saved elements no longer loose in the tab.
- **v4.82 — Tiles repeats the whole clip off-canvas** (0% -> 100% lit; the call was gated on the canvas bbox).
- **v4.83 — drawing mode no longer wrecks the Studio layout** (stage was collapsing 1140px -> 233px).
- **BUG-HUNT.md** — 74 findings, 69 confirmed, from a 22-agent hunt. Nothing in it is fixed yet.

## The queue

**Empty.** Everything Ezra queued on 2026-08-09/10 is shipped (v4.73 → v4.83). Next work comes
from him, or from BUG-HUNT.md — 69 confirmed findings, none of them fixed yet beyond the handful that
overlapped these items.

## How to work here

- **The projects on this machine are all throwaway tests** — Ezra, 2026-08-10: *"I honestly don't care
  if you wreck any of my projects at the moment, none of them are anything more than tests."* So tests
  and harnesses may add, mutate and delete layers freely; still restore state in a `finally` out of
  basic hygiene, but don't skip a worthwhile test to protect a project.
- Verify by RUNNING, not reading — the harness lesson has paid off repeatedly. Mutation-check every
  new test assertion: three in a row this session looked fine and could not actually fail.
- `index.html`'s version label is the source of truth. Bump it, bump the `?v=` on every file touched,
  add a POLISH-LOG line, commit locally. Ezra pushes via GitHub Desktop.
- Mobile check at ~380px on anything visual, unprompted.
